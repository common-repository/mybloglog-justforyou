Displays a list of posts related to visitor interests as found from MyBlogLog.

== Description ==

If your reader has a MyBlogLog account, the plug-in uses tags the user has added to their 
MyBlogLog profile to suggest posts from your archives matched to their interests. For non-MyBlogLog 
users, the plugin simply uses tags of your other recent visitors to recommend posts. The weighting
for a user's interests ranges from 10, a direct match between your posts' tags/categories and their
MyBlogLog tags to 1, a loose coupling.

== Installation ==

1. If you are upgrading from a previous version first de-activate the plugin, then delete the plugin folder from your server.

2. Upload the plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
